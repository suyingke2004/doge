# Google Developer Documentation Style Guide

This document outlines the key principles of the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide. For the full guide, please refer to [the official documentation](https://developers.google.com/style).

## Key Principles

*   **Audience:** Write for a global, technical audience.
*   **Voice and Tone:** Use an accessible, inclusive, and consistent voice. The tone should be professional and helpful.
*   **Tense and Voice:** Prefer the active voice and present tense.
*   **Clarity:** Prioritize clarity above all else. It's acceptable to break the rules for the sake of clarity, as long as the writing remains consistent.

## Formatting and Punctuation

*   Follow the specific rules for formatting, punctuation, and linking outlined in the guide.
*   Pay close attention to the guidelines for documenting computer interfaces, such as APIs and command-line syntax.

## Style Hierarchy

1.  **Project-specific style guide:** If a project has its own style guide, it should be followed first.
2.  **Google Developer Documentation Style Guide:** This guide should be followed next.
3.  **Third-party style guides:** If a specific issue is not covered by the above, refer to a third-party resource like the Chicago Manual of Style.

## Inclusivity

*   Use gender-neutral language.
*   Avoid ableist or offensive terms.

## 开发环境
