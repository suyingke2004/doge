This article discusses the relationship between stress and illness. It explains that long-term activation of the body's stress response system can lead to health problems. Psychophysiological Disorders: These are physical disorders where symptoms are caused or worsened by stress and emotional factors. Examples include cardiovascular issues like hypertension, gastrointestinal problems like irritable bowel syndrome, and respiratory conditions like asthma. Personality traits such as depression, anger, and anxiety have been linked to a higher risk of illness. Stress and the Immune System: The immune system protects the body from harmful invaders. When it malfunctions, it can lead to autoimmune diseases (attacking the body's own cells) or immunosuppression (reduced effectiveness). Stress can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections. The field of psychoneuroimmunology studies how psychological factors like stress impact the immune system. Research has shown that stress can be associated with weakened immune function, slower wound healing, and even accelerated aging at the cellular level by shortening telomeres. Cardiovascular Disorders: Heart disease is a major health issue, and stress is a significant risk factor. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major contributor to heart disease and can be exacerbated by job strain, marital conflict, and other stressors. The "Type A" behavior pattern, characterized by being a driven workaholic, was initially linked to heart disease, but further research has pinpointed the anger/hostility component as a more critical factor. Negative emotional states like depression are also strongly linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Asthma: Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease with airway obstruction. Psychological factors, especially stress and negative emotions, can trigger or worsen asthma attacks. Stressful life experiences, particularly conflicts, have been associated with the development of asthma. Headaches: Tension headaches, the most common type, are often triggered by stress, which can increase sensitivity to pain. Migraine headaches are also discussed, thought to be caused by blood vessel swelling.
