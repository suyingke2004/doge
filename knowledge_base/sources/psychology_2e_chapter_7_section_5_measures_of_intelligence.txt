The article discusses the concept of intelligence quotient (IQ) and its measurement. It explains that IQ is a score from a test designed to measure intelligence, and these tests have been debated throughout their history. The text notes that IQ tests have been used for various purposes, including controversial ones like the eugenics movement. The article traces the history of intelligence testing, starting with Sir Francis Galton in the late 1800s and Alfred Binet in the early 1900s. Binet developed a test for the French government to identify children who might struggle in school. This work was later modified by Louis Terman at Stanford, who standardized the test, creating the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. In 1939, David Wechsler developed a new IQ test, the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale, which later became the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). There are now several Wechsler tests used for different age groups. These tests are periodically recalibrated, which has led to the observation of the Flynn effectâ€”the trend that each generation has a higher IQ than the last. The article also explains the bell curve and how it's used in intelligence testing. The average IQ score is 100, with a standard deviation of 15 points. Scores between 85 and 115 are considered average. An IQ score below 70, along with other deficits, may lead to a diagnosis of intellectual disability. Conversely, a score of 130 or above is considered superior. Finally, the text highlights the value of IQ testing in educational and clinical settings for identifying individuals who may need extra support. It also mentions its use in the legal system.
