Prosocial Behavior and Altruism: The text defines prosocial behavior as voluntary actions intended to help others. Altruism is a form of prosocial behavior where someone helps another person even if the costs outweigh the benefits. Empathy, the ability to understand and share another's feelings, is suggested as a motivator for altruism. Forming Relationships: The most influential factor in forming relationships is proximity, meaning we're more likely to befriend people we have regular contact with. Similarity in background, attitudes, and lifestyle is another key factor. Reciprocity, the give-and-take in relationships, and self-disclosure, sharing personal information, are important for maintaining relationships. Attraction: People are generally attracted to physical attractiveness, but what is considered attractive can be culturally influenced. The matching hypothesis suggests that people tend to choose partners they see as their equals in physical attractiveness and social desirability. Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love: This theory proposes that love has three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. Different combinations of these components define different types of love. Social Exchange Theory: This theory suggests that we weigh the costs and benefits of our relationships. We are motivated to maximize benefits and minimize costs in our social interactions.
