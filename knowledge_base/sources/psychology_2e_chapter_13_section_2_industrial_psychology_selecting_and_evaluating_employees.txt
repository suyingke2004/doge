This chapter from a Psychology textbook focuses on Industrial Psychology, specifically on how employees are selected and evaluated. The main topics covered are: *   Employee Selection: This section explains how job descriptions are created using task-oriented or worker-oriented approaches. It also discusses the use of tests (like IQ and personality tests), interviews (structured vs. unstructured), and the importance of nonverbal cues in the hiring process. *   Training: This part covers the importance of orientation and ongoing training for employees. It also discusses mentoring and its benefits for both the mentor and the mentee. *   Evaluating Employees: This section describes performance appraisal systems, including the 360-degree feedback method. It also touches on the challenges of making evaluations fair and effective. *   Bias and Protections in Hiring: This section discusses how biases (like those against obese or unattractive candidates) can affect hiring decisions. It also outlines the legal protections in the United States against discrimination based on age, race, gender, religion, disability, and other factors. It mentions the role of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in enforcing these laws.
