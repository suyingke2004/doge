Social Roles: We all have multiple social roles (e.g., student, employee, friend), and these roles come with expected behaviors. Our behavior often changes depending on the social role we're in. Social Norms: These are a group's expectations for appropriate behavior. They define our social roles and are present in all aspects of life, from family to social media. Scripts: These are our knowledge of the sequence of events in a specific setting, like how to act in a restaurant or on the first day of school. Scripts guide our behavior and can vary across cultures. Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment: This famous experiment demonstrated the powerful influence of social roles, norms, and scripts. College students were randomly assigned to be "prisoners" or "guards" in a mock prison. The participants quickly and intensely adopted their roles, with the guards becoming sadistic and the prisoners showing signs of anxiety and hopelessness. The experiment was stopped early due to the deteriorating behavior of the participants. Criticisms of the Stanford Prison Experiment: The experiment has been criticized for ethical reasons and for issues with generalizability. Some critics argue that the way participants were recruited may have influenced the outcome and that Zimbardo may have given the guards specific instructions on how to behave. Attempts to replicate the study have not always been successful. Parallels to Abu Ghraib: The text draws a parallel between the Stanford Prison Experiment and the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison by U.S. military personnel.
