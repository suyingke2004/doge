This is a chapter on Observational Learning (Modeling) from a Psychology textbook. Here's a summary of the key points: *   Observational learning is learning by watching others and imitating their behavior. The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models. *   Psychologist Albert Bandura proposed social learning theory, which includes cognitive processes in learning. *   There are three types of models: live, verbal, and symbolic. *   The four steps in the modeling process are attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation. *   Observational learning can have both prosocial (positive) and antisocial (negative) effects. *   The famous Bobo doll experiment showed that children imitate the aggressive behavior of adults. *   Research suggests a link between exposure to media violence and aggression, but other factors may also play a role.
