Amnesia: Amnesia is the loss of long-term memory due to disease, or physical or psychological trauma. There are two main types of amnesia: Anterograde amnesia: The inability to remember new information after the injury. The hippocampus is often affected, which prevents the consolidation of memories from short-term to long-term. Retrograde amnesia: The loss of memory for events that occurred before the trauma. Memory Construction and Reconstruction: The formation of new memories is called construction, and recalling old memories is called reconstruction. Memories are flexible and can be altered during retrieval, leading to inaccuracies. Suggestibility is the effect of external misinformation leading to false memories. This is a major issue in eyewitness testimony. Eyewitness misidentification is a leading cause of wrongful convictions. The Misinformation Effect: Developed by Elizabeth Loftus, the misinformation effect paradigm states that a person's memory of an event can be altered by exposure to additional, and possibly inaccurate, information. Forgetting: Encoding failure occurs when we never store information in our memory in the first place. Psychologist Daniel Schacter identified seven sins of memory: 1.  Transience: Memories fade over time (storage decay). 2.  Absentmindedness: Lapses in memory due to breaks in attention. 3.  Blocking: The temporary inability to access stored information (tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon). 4.  Misattribution: Confusing the source of a memory. 5.  Suggestibility: Creation of false memories from external sources. 6.  Bias: Current feelings and worldview distorting memories of past events. 7.  Persistence: The inability to forget undesirable memories. Interference: Interference is when stored information is inaccessible. There are two types of interference: Proactive interference: Old information hinders the recall of new information. Retroactive interference: Newer information hinders the recall of older information.
